### Dig Into Ruby

1. Inside your code folder, create a new Rails called ```poker``` by typing ```rails new poker```
1. In your Rails project, support the following URL: ```http://localhost:3000/poker``` and simulate the dealing of a 5-card hand of poker (i.e. five random playing cards) – use [https://github.com/kiei925-winter15/poker](https://github.com/kiei925-winter15/poker) for a good starting point.
1. Commit your repository with your Github account so that it's accessible via ```http://github.com/<your username>/poker```
